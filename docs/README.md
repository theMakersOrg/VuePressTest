# open night

## Open nights are for everyone!
To participate in one of our Thursday nights **all you need to do is turn up!** 

Open to the public at 5:30pm - till late...

We will give you a tour of the facilties and you will most likely get to see some makers is their natural habitat. We usually pass the hat around at some stage and order pizza to fuel the engines. Once you have signed in ( feel free to add you email if you want to join out slack channel or <create@themakers.org>).

We have a limited number of Raspberry Pi / SOC workstations where you can pug into a monitor and have power and ethernet at your disposal.

Also available for use on Thursdays is our workbench with soldering and most hand tools.

Dont worry if it looks a little crowded we have another two rooms and an undercover workspace for the more noisy / dirt operations :).
